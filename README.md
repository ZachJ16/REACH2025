The codes in this repository are for my Research Enriched Academic Challenge (REACH) project at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC), titled Restoring Tactile Sensation to Transradial Amputees with a Non-Invasive Design for Prosthetic Hands
The microcontroller used for this project is Teensy4.1, and was communicated with using the Arduino IDE libraries. 

Force Sensor code is for implementation of a FlexiForce A201 piezoelectric force sensor.

Thermocouple code is for implentaion of a Diligent K-Type Thermocouple. 

Additionally there are motor_test and acutator_test to show correct electrical connections and working ability of feedback of haptic functions.
